## About me

My background in graphic design gave me ease to work with UI Design. And with this came the interest of working with development, mainly frontend. Lately I've focused my studies on JavaScript, React lib and its entire ecosystem.

I spend my free time helping the open source community, studying, photographing or watching movies and TV shows.
